## Human review queue (Robel)

Items the agent must NOT resolve itself:
- [ ] PyPI name availability result (Task 0) — confirm final package name.
  Agent finding 2026-07-10: PyPI JSON API returned 404 for all of `habesha-names`, `habeshanames`, `etnames` → all three available. Proceeding with `habesha-names` pending Robel's confirmation. (Note: the HTML page `pypi.org/project/habesha-names/` returned HTTP 200, but it was a "Client Challenge" anti-bot page, not a project page — the JSON API is the authoritative check.)
- [ ] Consonant label override in `scripts/gen_fidel_tables.py` (Task 1): `TS → "ts'"` (ejective marking, pinned by the plan). All other labels are mechanical lowercased Unicode name fragments (e.g. ሐ→`hh`, ኀ→`x`, ጠ→`th`, ፀ→`tz`, አ→`glottal`, ዐ→`pharyngeal`) — internal series IDs, NOT romanizations; confirm they are acceptable as internal labels or extend the override map when Task 3 defines the PRACTICAL scheme.
- [ ] `translit/schemes.py` PRACTICAL table — native-speaker review
- [ ] All `given_names.json` entries with `"verified": false`
- [ ] Golden corpus entries marked `"needs_human": true`
- [ ] Final match-score thresholds (Task 8 tuning)
- [ ] Release tag push (Task 10)

## Session 1 — 2026-07-10

Task attempted: Task 0 — Repo scaffold + CI

What was actually done:
- Created `pyproject.toml` (setuptools src layout, PEP 639 license metadata, dynamic version from `habesha_names.__version__`, dev extras pytest/ruff/mypy, ruff + mypy + pytest config), MIT `LICENSE` (Robel Shemeles, 2026), `.gitignore`, `README.md` stub.
- Created `src/habesha_names/__init__.py` (`__version__ = "0.1.0.dev0"`), `py.typed`, empty subpackages `fidel/`, `translit/`, `parse/`, `match/`, `data/` (each with a docstring-only `__init__.py`).
- Created `tests/test_smoke.py` (version pin + subpackage import test).
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: ubuntu-latest, matrix Python 3.9–3.13, steps: `pip install -e .[dev]` → `ruff check .` → `mypy src` → `pytest -q`.
- Created `.venv`, installed dev deps, ran the Verify block twice (see below for why twice).
- Checked PyPI name availability (result recorded in Human review queue above): all three candidate names free; staying with `habesha-names`.
- `git init` + initial commit `task-0: repo scaffold + CI`.

Verification output (paste FULL command + output, unedited):

Command (run via cmd batch file, per Task 0 Verify block, after `cd /d D:\habesha-names && call .venv\Scripts\activate.bat`):

    pip install -e .[dev] && python -c "import habesha_names; print(habesha_names.__version__)" && pytest -q && ruff check . && mypy src

Deviations from plan (and why):
- Local Python is 3.13.2, not 3.11 as AGENT_KICKOFF.md states. All verification ran on 3.13.2; CI matrix still covers 3.9–3.13.
- The first verify run passed (exit 0) but mypy 2.2.0 warned `python_version: Python 3.9 is not supported (must be 3.10 or higher)` — mypy 2.x dropped 3.9 as a check target, so the pin was silently ignored. Removed `python_version = "3.9"` from `[tool.mypy]`; each CI job type-checks against its own interpreter, and the 3.9 matrix job (which resolves an older mypy) covers 3.9 semantics. Re-ran the full Verify block clean (output above).
- `data/` was given a docstring-only `__init__.py` (regular package, not a bare directory) so `importlib.resources` works uniformly on Python 3.9 when Task 4 lands.
- PyPI availability was verified via the JSON API instead of the project HTML page — the HTML page serves an anti-bot challenge (HTTP 200 "Client Challenge") to curl, making its status code meaningless.

Known issues / TODOs introduced: none. CI workflow is committed but has never executed (no remote configured yet) — first push to GitHub should confirm the matrix is green.

Next session should start with: Task 1 — Fidel tables + syllable decomposition (`scripts/gen_fidel_tables.py`, generated `fidel/tables.py`, `fidel/syllable.py`).

## Session 2 — 2026-07-10

Task attempted: Task 1 — Fidel tables + syllable decomposition

What was actually done:
- Explored the real Unicode structure of U+1200–U+137F and U+1380–U+139F via a scratchpad script (`unicodedata` 15.1.0) before writing anything: 342 syllables, 42 non-syllable codepoints (marks/punct/digits/tonal). Three structural irregularities found and handled: U+131F GGWAA uses eighth-column suffix `WAA`; U+1359 MYA and U+135A FYA are standalone one-off syllables inside the RYA row; supplement block is 4-aligned groups (orders 1/3/5/6) with a `SEBATBEIT ` name prefix on each group base.
- `scripts/gen_fidel_tables.py`: derives every mapping from `unicodedata.name()` (nothing hand-typed), validates block structure (fails loudly on unknown suffixes / misaligned orders / label collisions / non-bijective reverse table), emits `src/habesha_names/fidel/tables.py` with a GENERATED header; `--check` mode diffs regenerated output against the committed file.
- Generated `fidel/tables.py`: `ETHIOPIC_RANGES`, `LABIALIZED_ORDER`, `CONSONANT_BY_BASE` (50 series), `SYLLABLES` (342 entries, codepoint → (consonant label, order 1–8)), `CODEPOINT_BY_SYLLABLE` (reverse bijection).
- `fidel/syllable.py`: `Syllable` NamedTuple, `decompose`, `compose`, `is_ethiopic` (block-range based; whitespace ignored, mixed script → False), all with runnable docstring examples using only plan-given glyphs.
- `tests/test_fidel_syllable.py`: 15 tests — the 5 plan pin glyphs each cross-checked against `unicodedata.name` inside the test; full-table roundtrip; independent unicodedata scan proving table coverage is exact; independent re-derivation of series/orders from Unicode names; error paths; `is_ethiopic` cases.
- Consonant labels are mechanical lowercased Unicode fragments except one override `TS → "ts'"` (plan-pinned, ejective) — flagged `verified: false` in the generator and generated header, added to Human review queue.

Verification output (paste FULL command + output, unedited):

Command (cmd, per Task 1 Verify block, after `cd /d D:\habesha-names && call .venv\Scripts\activate.bat`):

Output (final run):

    OK: tables.py is current (342 syllables, 50 series)

    Success: no issues found in 8 source files
    EXIT CODE: 0

Files touched: `scripts/gen_fidel_tables.py` (new), `src/habesha_names/fidel/tables.py` (generated, new), `src/habesha_names/fidel/syllable.py` (new), `tests/test_fidel_syllable.py` (new), `PROGRESS.md`

Deviations from plan (and why):
- Plan says "series bases → … vowel orders, labialized forms" without prescribing shape: labialized forms are represented as vowel order 8 (`LABIALIZED_ORDER`) within their parent series rather than as separate series, because Unicode lays them out at row offset 7 (suffixes -WA/-OA/-WAA); the five labialized-velar series (qw/qhw/xw/kw/kxw/gw at their own row bases) and the four supplement series (mw/bw/fw/pw) ARE separate series, matching Unicode structure.
- `ETHIOPIC_RANGES` includes Ethiopic Extended U+2D80–U+2DDF (per ARCHITECTURE §4.1 Unicode coverage) so `is_ethiopic` recognizes it; it has no syllable table in v0.1 (Task 1 scope is the two blocks named in the plan), so `decompose` raises ValueError for it — documented and tested.

Known issues / TODOs introduced: consonant labels for non-obvious series (hh/x/sz/tz/qh/kx/dd/gg/th/ch/ph/glottal/pharyngeal…) are internal Unicode-derived IDs, not romanizations — Task 3's PRACTICAL scheme must not blindly reuse them (queued for human review above).

Next session should start with: Task 2 — Fidel normalization (`fidel/normalize.py`: homophone collapsing via decompose/compose, NFC, Ethiopic punctuation strip, whitespace normalize, idempotency property test).

## Decisions log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-10 | stdlib-only runtime, MIT, src layout | ARCHITECTURE §2 |
| 2026-07-10 | fidel tables generated, never hand-typed | Hallucination risk |
| 2026-07-10 | all agent-seeded linguistic data ships `verified: false` | Native-speaker gate |
| 2026-07-10 | no `python_version` pin in `[tool.mypy]` | mypy 2.x dropped 3.9 as a check target; CI 3.9 job covers 3.9 semantics |
| 2026-07-10 | PEP 639 license metadata (`license = "MIT"`, setuptools>=77) | Table-form `license` is deprecated/being removed in setuptools |
| 2026-07-10 | Labialized fidel = vowel order 8 within its series (`LABIALIZED_ORDER`) | Matches Unicode row layout (offset 7, -WA/-OA/-WAA names); keeps decompose/compose a clean bijection |
| 2026-07-10 | Consonant labels = lowercased Unicode name fragments + minimal override map (`TS→ts'`) | Mechanical derivation carries zero hallucination risk; overrides are flagged linguistic data |
| 2026-07-10 | `is_ethiopic` is block-range based (incl. Extended, punct, digits, marks); all-non-whitespace-chars semantics | Simple, deterministic; parser does finer-grained script detection in Task 5 |
